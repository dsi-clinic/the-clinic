# Peer Review

During the quarter you will be asked to do a peer review exercise where you provide feedback to your team about the level of effort you have observed.

There are **no make-up peer reviews**, so please make sure to look at Canvas to know when they are due and complete them. 

This assignment has a few objectives that are _incredibly_ important to remember. 

1. It provides you with the opportunity to provide feedback to your teammates about workload and effort.
2. It provides everyone with valuable information about their own effort and how it is perceived by others.
  
There are very few times when you will have the opportunity to receive feedback from your peers in a controlled environment like this, so make the most of this opportunity. 

Before going into the specifics of the grading there are a few important notes to keep in mind about the review:

1. While students are required to complete the peer review, TAs, Mentors, and the clinic administration may also include their feedback. 
2. The peer review makes up only a small portion of the final grade. 
3. Being self-aware about how others perceive your effort is a powerful tool, and signals such as this one are useful to hone your skills.


## Grading

The peer review is graded as follows:

| Score | Interpretation | 
| --- | --- | 
| 0 | Incomplete / form not completed | 
| 1 | Feedback on your work product, professionalism, and team skills was negative and significant. | 
| 3 | There are some concerns about your performance. Your teammates expressed concerns about your contribution during this period. |
| 5 | Full credit |

### What if I don't receive full credit? 

While every situation is different, taking a step back to reflect on your performance is the first place to start.

Some things to think about:
- Did you show up on time? 
- Did you complete the work in a timely manner?
- Did you contribute during working sessions? 
- Did you communicate appropriately and in a timely manner via Slack, email, etc.? 

**REMEMBER:** The purpose of this exercise is to provide feedback to you about how people are interpreting your work. This is not a judgment on you, but a signal regarding how others see the work product that you put out. 

**THIS FEEDBACK** is invaluable! If you are working hard and not receiving full credit on the peer review, this means that there is a misalignment between how your peers see you and the work product you are putting out. Understanding why so you can avoid this situation in a real-world setting (which may cost you a promotion or salary increase) is the goal of this!

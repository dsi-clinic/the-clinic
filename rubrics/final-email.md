# Final Email

Upon finishing the video, one-pager and code requirements, all groups need to send a summary email to their external mentors, TAs, students and clinic administrators.

This is a professionally written email thanking them for the opportunity to work on the project as well as information on the final results.

This email should contain the following links and documents:

1. A link your final presentation. Generally it is okay to share via a google drive link. **However**, if you are working on an industry project or one with an NDA, please make sure that whatever sharing method you use targets the sharing to only the intended recipients. 
2. A copy of the final one pager (in pdf form).
3. A link to the github repository and code produced. You should also verify that the external mentors have access to the github repository. 

The email should also contain a short summary which:
1. Thanks the external mentors for their time during and before the quarter.
1. States that this is the final deliverable for this quarter and if there are any additional questions they should contact the clinic director directly.

### F.A.Q.


| We only met with our external mentor once during the quarter, do we still need to send them an email?    |
| ----------- |
| Yes. Each external mentor chooses their level of clinic participation differently. Please remember that the external mentor is human, they are not getting paid to provide their time and the quarters are short. Mentors may want to meet more frequently, but there may be higher priorities or life things that may occur which prevent that from happening. |

| We aren't sure who to include on the email. We had some mentors that were in every meeting, but some who only showed up occasionally. |
| --- |
| This is not uncommon! In this case use your best judgement and ask your internal mentor their thoughts. One option if you aren't sure is to mention, in the email that you were not sure if they should be included or not. |

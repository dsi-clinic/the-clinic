## TA Responsibilities in the Data Science Clinic

### Overview
This document outlines the standard responsibilities of a Teaching Assistant (TA) in the Data Science Clinic. Please note that specific duties may vary as different mentors might request additional tasks. The responsibilities listed here form the baseline expectations.

**Important**: All TAs should review the [TA Training Repository](https://github.com/dsi-clinic/ta-training) and complete the [TA Training Presentation](https://dsi-clinic.github.io/ta-training/) before beginning their duties. These resources provide essential guidance on technical standards, pedagogical approaches, and professional practices.

### Core Responsibilities
TAs are expected to:

- Assist with git operations, including evaluating and merging pull requests.
- Meet with external mentors as needed.
- Provide support for various assessment mechanisms.
- Evaluate, during finals week, up to two repositories using the checklist found [here](../rubrics/final-technical-cleanup.md).

### Conducting TA Sessions

- **Frequency**: Conduct two **in-person** TA sessions each week.
- **Location and Time**: Sessions should be held at the designated location and time for the project.
- **Nature of Sessions**: Sessions are intended to be interactive working periods. TAs should offer assistance related to the project, including technical support, advice, and troubleshooting.

### Role in Student Support

- TAs serve as the initial point of contact for students' technical, logistical, and administrative queries.
- Ensure active engagement and support during office hours.

### Attendance and Grading

- **Weekly Reporting**: TAs must report student attendance weekly through Canvas.
- **Scoring System**: Attendance is scored out of 5. Late arrivals (up to 10 minutes) receive a 3/5 score. Those more than 10 minutes late are marked with a zero.

### Final week grading

- **Technical Assessment:** At the end of the quarter, each TA will evaluate two repositories using a checklist. This checklist can be found [here](../rubrics/final-technical-cleanup.md).

### Handling Student Inquiries

- If students question their grades, especially those related to attendance, refer them to the clinic director, Nick Ross. Include any relevant information in your communication.

### FAQ

1. **What if a student is ill or has COVID and requests a TA session via Zoom?**
   
   - Allow them to attend via Zoom, but ensure they email the clinic director to record this exception.

2. **What should I do if a student asks me to complete their work?**
   
   - Report this immediately via email or Slack to your project mentor and the clinic director.


3. **I have a student who is behaving unprofessionally during the TA session.**

    - Report this back to your mentor and the clinic directory ASAP. 

### Final Note

While students are students and a core part of the clinic experience is learning, it is not the purpose of the TA to correct unprofessional/undisciplined/improper behavior. If you feel that any of these is occurring please report it to your mentor and the clinic director ASAP.

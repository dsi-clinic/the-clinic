## FAQ

###  Can the students present their research at a conference?
Where we have had success:
* Poster sessions locally during a quarter. These work really well, a subset of students can generally attend and they are good events for everyone. We are able to print posters.
* Non-academic publications, such as white papers in the public interest space. In this case much of the work tends to be exploratory and relatively light weight, so it is much easier to review.
* If the research interest aligns with the (internal/UChicago) mentor's interest. In this case there is alignment and the UChicago mentor has the incentive to verify as well as the requisite knowledge to understand the research questions, how to write it, etc.

A couple of caveats:
* Generally speaking students will promise to do additional work after the quarter ends, but will not. So if the conference deadline is after the quarter then I'd expect to have to do the work yourself. While some students may continue onto the project into another quarter there is no guarantee.
* Student work... is student work. We do our best to put in place systems (TAs, mentors, etc.) to help review things, but I wouldn't (personally) put my name on any of the work that a student has done without reviewing it in detail myself.
